# MongoDB Realm and React Native Getting Started



## Part One
This is the first in a series of videos about using MongoDB realm with React Native specifically taking advantage of the offline and sync capabilities. I have used Mongodb realm once before in an Ionic Framework video series listed below, so you can take a look to get an idea of the direction I am heading with this video series

In this first video, we are just following along with the documentation to get a react native application up and running with the realm library installed and do some basic CRUD actions without a React Native UI.

As we move through the series we will fill out the app more and show how to integrate MongoDB Realm in a React Native application.
